<!-- Note: The data is from Instagram only  -->

# 5. Preprocessing Instagram Data â€“ (backend/preprocessing.js)

## This module cleans Instagram data for further analysis, removing irrelevant characters from hashtags.

**Future Suggestions**:

1. Data Lakes: Use AWS S3 to store preprocessed data. Data from different sources (Instagram, user profiles) can be stored in an S3 bucket.

2. AWS Glue: Use AWS Glue for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) before performing analytics.

**Interview-Oriented Question**:

How would you preprocess large datasets efficiently?

Answer:

1. Use distributed processing frameworks like Apache Spark (can be managed using AWS EMR) for efficient handling of large datasets.
2. Implement batch processing or streaming for real-time data analysis (AWS Kinesis).
