# 3. Recommendation Controller â€“ (backend/controllers/recommendationController.js)

## This module fetches data and suggests activities based on user preferences (adventure, relaxation, etc.).

**AWS Suggestions**:

1. Deploy AWS RDS for scalable databases and integrate it securely with your API.

2. Use RDS Performance Insights to monitor database performance, including query optimization.

**Interview-Oriented Question**:

How would you optimize recommendation queries for large datasets?

Answer:

1. Indexing: Create indexes on frequently queried fields such as user_id, destination, and vibe.

2. Pagination: When fetching large data (such as reviews), use pagination to avoid loading too much data into memory at once.

3. Caching: Implement Redis or AWS ElastiCache for caching frequent queries to reduce database load.
