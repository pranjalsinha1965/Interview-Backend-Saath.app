# 6. Application Setup and Scaling on AWS

## AWS Deployment Summary:

1. AWS Elastic Beanstalk: Deploy your Node.js app easily by pushing the code through the AWS EB CLI. AWS will handle scaling, load balancing, and patching.

2. AWS RDS: Host the MySQL database in Amazon RDS with automated backups, read replicas, and scaling.

3. AWS CloudWatch: Use CloudWatch for monitoring logs and setting up alerts in case of API failures.

4. AWS Lambda: Consider moving to a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda for cost-efficiency and scalability.

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk Example: 

```bash 
# Initialize Beanstalk environment
eb init
# Create the environment
eb create travel-itinerary-env
# Deploy the Node.js app
eb deploy
