# 4. Itinerary Routes â€“ (backend/routes/itineraryRoutes.js)

## This module defines a route that generates itineraries based on user ID and destination.

**Suggestions**:

Secure the API using JWT authentication. Ensure the user is authorized to access certain itineraries.
Enable CORS for cross-origin requests if the frontend is hosted separately.

**Interview-Oriented Question**:

How would you scale this API to handle thousands of concurrent users?

Answer:

1. Load Balancing: Use Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute traffic across multiple instances.

2. Auto-scaling: Configure Auto Scaling Groups in AWS Elastic Beanstalk to handle traffic spikes.

3. CDN: Use CloudFront to cache static content, reducing the load on the backend.
